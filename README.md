# United_Study_Interface



There are different platforms for test giving and lectures in schools and colleges. Students need to optimize their time by taking meets as lectures. 
And then using word and docs to implement their studying in the form of assignments. Lectures are also uploaded on different platforms that require some form of authorization and consent, but one such platform where all such components are available is not present. it takes an investment of time, resources, and work into the whole process when it could be converted into a smaller time frame authorization.
